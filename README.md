Usage

Once the server is running, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the application. From there, you can browse restaurants, view menus, and place orders.

Handling CORS Issues

If you encounter any issues fetching data from the API due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions, you can use a browser extension to bypass these restrictions.

Install a CORS extension:

For Chrome: Install the CORS Unblock extension. For Firefox: Install the CORS Everywhere extension. Enable the extension: Once installed, enable the extension in your browser. This will allow your application to bypass CORS restrictions when fetching data from the API.

Refresh the application: After enabling the CORS extension, refresh your browser to ensure that data is fetched correctly.
